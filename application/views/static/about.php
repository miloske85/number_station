                    <p>This site is an internet alternative to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Numbers_station">numbers stations</a>. Everyone can post a message without registering. Free registration gives the user an ability to delete his/her messages, send private messages to other users and there is no need to fill out the name and CAPTCHA code each time message is posted.</p>
                    <p>I created this for fun and as an exercise in Codeigniter framework. This code is open source (MIT). <a href="http://miloske.tk/#contact">Contact me</a> for more details. Any comments, suggestions and questions are welcome.</p>
